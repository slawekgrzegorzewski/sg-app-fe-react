    Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide
    between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `UNAVAILABLE`:

    - Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
    - Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
    the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
    fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
    should be returned since the client should not retry unless
    the files are deleted from the directory.
